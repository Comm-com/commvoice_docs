## What is an AI Call?

In CommVoice, an **AI call** represents a conversation between one of your AI agents and a prospect or customer. Each call involves sophisticated natural language processing, real-time conversation management, and intelligent outcome determination. The AI agent conducts the entire conversation autonomously, from initial greeting to call conclusion.
