## Your Classification Schema

The set of outcomes that you use to classify your calls is known as your classification schema. This schema is the foundation of your AI classification system, and it's important to design it in a way that aligns with your business goals and provides you with actionable data.

### Standard vs. Custom Outcomes

CommVoice provides a set of standard, pre-configured outcomes that are a great starting point for many businesses. However, you also have the flexibility to create your own custom outcomes to tailor the classification process to your specific needs.

## Creating and Editing Outcomes

You can manage your classification outcomes from the classification setup page in the Settings menu.

### Best Practices for Outcome Management

*   **Be consistent:** Use a consistent naming convention for your outcomes.
*   **Be specific:**  Avoid vague or ambiguous outcome names.
*   **Don't overcomplicate:** A simpler schema with fewer outcomes is often more effective than a complex one with too many.
*   **Get feedback from your team:**  If you have a sales team that will be using the outcome data, get their input on what outcomes would be most useful to them.

By carefully managing your classification outcomes, you can create a powerful and flexible system for analyzing your call data and driving business results.
