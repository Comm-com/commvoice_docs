## The Importance of Testing

Testing is a crucial step in the process of setting up AI classification. By testing your configuration, you can:

*   **Validate your classification rules:**  Ensure that your rules are accurately identifying the outcomes you want to track.
*   **Identify any gaps or errors:**  Find and fix any issues with your configuration before you roll it out to all of your campaigns.
*   **Build confidence in your data:**  Be confident that the data you are collecting is accurate and reliable.

## How to Test Your Classification

The CommVoice platform provides a simple yet powerful tool for testing your classification setup.

### The Classification Tester

The Classification Tester allows you to see how the AI would classify a given piece of text based on your current configuration. To use the tester, simply paste in a snippet of a call transcript and click the "Test" button. The AI will then analyze the text and show you which outcome it would assign to the call.

### Using the Tester to Refine Your Rules

The Classification Tester is an invaluable tool for refining your classification rules. You can use it to:

*   **Test different phrasings:** See how the AI responds to different ways of expressing the same idea.
*   **Identify false positives and negatives:** Find cases where the AI is either incorrectly assigning an outcome or failing to assign an outcome when it should.
*   **Fine-tune your keywords:**  Experiment with different keywords and phrases to see which are most effective at identifying your target outcomes.

## A Continuous Process

Testing your classification should not be a one-time event. As your business and campaigns evolve, you will need to continue to test and refine your classification setup to ensure that it remains accurate and relevant. By making testing a regular part of your workflow, you can ensure that you are always getting the most out of the CommVoice platform's AI classification capabilities.
