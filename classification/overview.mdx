## What is AI Call Outcome Classification?

AI call outcome classification is the process by which CommVoice's AI agents analyze conversations in real-time to determine the result of the call. This allows the agent to intelligently steer the conversation, take the appropriate next steps, and provide you with accurate, automated reporting.

## Key Classification Capabilities

*   **Real-time Decision Making:** The AI agent doesn't just classify calls after the fact; it uses its understanding of the conversation to make decisions in real-time, such as when to push for an appointment or when to back off.
*   **Customizable Outcomes:** You can define your own outcome categories and classification rules to align with your specific business goals.
*   **Continuous Learning:** The AI learns from every conversation, continuously improving its ability to accurately classify outcomes and handle a wide range of scenarios.

By leveraging the power of real-time AI classification, you can ensure that every call is handled in the most effective way possible and that you have the accurate data you need to optimize your campaigns.
