## Getting Started with AI Classification

Setting up AI classification is a key step in leveraging the full power of the CommVoice platform. By teaching the AI to recognize your specific business outcomes, you can automate your workflows, gain deeper insights into your campaign performance, and ultimately, drive better results.

### The Classification Setup Page

You can access the classification setup page from the Settings menu in the CommVoice dashboard. This is where you will define your call outcomes and configure the rules that the AI will use to classify your calls.

## Defining Your Outcomes

The first step in setting up AI classification is to define the call outcomes that are relevant to your business. You can use a combination of CommVoice's standard outcomes and your own custom outcomes.

For each outcome, you will need to provide:

*   **A name and description:**  This will help you and your team understand what the outcome represents.
*   **Classification rules:** This is the most important part of the setup process. You will need to provide the AI with the keywords, phrases, and other criteria that it should use to identify this outcome. For example, for a "Qualified Lead" outcome, you might include phrases like "I'm interested," "What are the next steps?," or "Can you send me a proposal?"

## Training the AI

Once you have defined your outcomes and classification rules, the next step is to train the AI. You can do this by providing the AI with examples of calls that fall into each outcome category. The more examples you provide, the more accurate the AI will become at classifying your calls.

You can also use the "Test" feature to see how the AI would classify a particular call based on your current configuration. This is a great way to fine-tune your classification rules and ensure that they are working as expected.

## Activating AI Classification

Once you are satisfied with your configuration, you can activate AI classification for your campaigns. The AI will then start to automatically classify all of your new calls based on the rules you have defined.

Remember that AI classification is an ongoing process. As your business and campaigns evolve, you may need to update your outcomes and classification rules to reflect those changes. By regularly reviewing and refining your classification setup, you can ensure that you are always getting the most accurate and actionable data from your calls.
