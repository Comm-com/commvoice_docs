## Your Team of AI Agents

In CommVoice, AI agents are the virtual workforce that conducts phone conversations on your behalf. Each agent is a distinct entity with its own personality, voice, and configuration. You can create a team of specialized agents, each designed to excel at a specific task, such as lead qualification, appointment setting, or customer support.

### The Agent Dashboard

The Agent Dashboard is your central hub for managing your team of AI agents. From here, you can:

*   **View all your agents:** See a list of all the AI agents you've created.
*   **Monitor agent performance:** Track key metrics for each agent, such as the number of calls made, the connection rate, and the rate of successful outcomes.
*   **Create new agents:**  Build new agents from scratch or from a template.
*   **Edit existing agents:**  Fine-tune the personality, voice, and scripts of your existing agents.

## Creating and Configuring AI Agents

Creating a new AI agent is a straightforward process. In the Agent Dashboard, you can either create a new agent from scratch or use one of our pre-built templates as a starting point.

When you create or edit an agent, you can configure the following attributes:

*   **Name and Persona:** Give your agent a name and a brief description of its personality (e.g., "Friendly and professional" or "Direct and to-the-point").
*   **Voice:** Choose from a variety of natural-sounding voices for your agent.
*   **Scripts:**  Write the conversation scripts that your agent will use, including opening lines, key questions, and responses to common objections.
*   **Knowledge Base:**  Provide your agent with the information it needs to answer customer questions accurately.

## The Power of Specialization

One of the key advantages of using AI agents is the ability to create a team of specialists. For example, you could have:

*   An **"Outbound Sales Agent"** that is an expert at cold calling and lead qualification.
*   An **"Appointment Setter Agent"** that is skilled at navigating complex schedules and booking meetings.
*   A **"Customer Support Agent"** that is patient, empathetic, and knowledgeable about your products.

By creating a team of specialized agents, you can ensure that you always have the right "person" for the job, leading to better outcomes and a more positive customer experience.
