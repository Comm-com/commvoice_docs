## What are Voice Accounts?

Voice accounts are the underlying telephony connections that your AI agents use to make and receive phone calls. In order to use the CommVoice platform, you will need to connect at least one voice account.

### Types of Voice Accounts

CommVoice supports two main types of voice accounts:

*   **SIP Trunks:**  If you have an existing VoIP phone system, you can connect it to CommVoice using a SIP trunk. This is a good option for businesses that want to use their existing phone numbers and infrastructure.
*   **Phone Numbers from CommVoice:**  If you don't have an existing phone system, you can purchase phone numbers directly from CommVoice. This is a quick and easy way to get started with the platform.

## Managing Your Voice Accounts

You can manage your voice accounts from the Settings page in the CommVoice dashboard.

### Adding a New Voice Account

To add a new voice account, simply click the "Add Voice Account" button and follow the on-screen instructions. The process will vary depending on whether you are connecting a SIP trunk or purchasing a phone number.

### Assigning Voice Accounts to Agents

Once you have added a voice account, you can assign it to one or more of your AI agents. This allows you to control which phone numbers your agents use for outbound calls. You can also assign different voice accounts to different agents, which can be useful for A/B testing or for creating agents with different geographic presences.

## Voicemail Configuration

You can also configure how your voice accounts handle incoming calls that go to voicemail. You can choose to have the AI agent leave a pre-recorded message, or you can have the call simply hang up.

By properly managing your voice accounts, you can ensure that your AI agents have a reliable and professional way to communicate with your customers.
