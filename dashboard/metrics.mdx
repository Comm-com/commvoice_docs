## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The CommVoice dashboard provides a comprehensive set of metrics to help you understand the performance of your AI-powered calling campaigns at a glance. These KPIs are designed to give you actionable insights into everything from call volume and connection rates to conversation quality and lead generation.

### Call Volume Metrics

*   **Total Calls:** The total number of calls initiated by your AI agents within the selected time frame. This is a top-level indicator of your campaign's activity.
*   **Connected Calls:** The number of calls that were successfully connected to a person, excluding voicemails and failed calls. This metric helps you understand the quality of your contact list.
*   **Connection Rate:** The percentage of total calls that were successfully connected. A low connection rate may indicate issues with your contact data or calling times.

### Conversation Metrics

*   **Average Call Duration:** The average length of a connected call. This can be an indicator of engagement; longer calls often signify more substantive conversations.
*   **Conversation Rate:** The percentage of connected calls that resulted in a meaningful two-way conversation, as determined by the AI. This metric helps you gauge the effectiveness of your AI agents' opening scripts.

### Outcome Metrics

*   **Qualified Leads:** The number of calls that resulted in a "Qualified Lead" outcome. This is a direct measure of your campaign's success in generating new business opportunities.
*   **Appointments Scheduled:** The number of calls that resulted in a scheduled appointment or demo. This is a key metric for sales-focused campaigns.
*   **Outcome Distribution:** A breakdown of all call outcomes, showing you the percentage of calls that fall into each category (e.g., Qualified Lead, Not Interested, Voicemail).

## Analyzing Your Metrics

By regularly monitoring these metrics, you can:

*   **Identify Trends:**  Spot patterns in your campaign performance over time.
*   **Optimize Your Strategy:**  Make data-driven decisions about which scripts, agents, and calling times are most effective.
*   **Improve ROI:**  Focus your efforts on the campaigns and strategies that are delivering the best results.

The CommVoice dashboard allows you to filter and segment your data in various ways, so you can drill down into the specifics of your performance and uncover the insights you need to succeed.
