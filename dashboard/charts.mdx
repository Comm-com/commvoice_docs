## Visualizing Your Data

The CommVoice dashboard features a variety of interactive charts that allow you to visualize your campaign data in a clear and intuitive way. These charts are designed to help you quickly identify trends, spot anomalies, and understand the story behind your numbers.

### Key Charts and Their Uses

*   **Call Volume Over Time:** This line chart shows the total number of calls made each day, allowing you to track your campaign's activity levels and identify any significant spikes or dips.
*   **Connection Rate by Hour:** This bar chart breaks down your connection rate by the hour of the day, helping you identify the optimal times to run your campaigns for maximum reach.
*   **Outcome Distribution Pie Chart:** This chart provides a visual breakdown of your call outcomes, showing you what percentage of your calls are resulting in qualified leads, appointments, or other outcomes.
*   **Agent Performance Comparison:** This chart allows you to compare the performance of your different AI agents across key metrics, helping you identify which personalities and scripts are most effective.

## Interactive Features

The charts in the CommVoice dashboard are not just static images; they are interactive tools that you can use to explore your data in more detail.

*   **Hover for Details:** Hover your mouse over any data point on a chart to see a tooltip with the exact numbers and other relevant information.
*   **Click to Filter:** In many charts, you can click on a data series to filter the rest of the dashboard by that selection. For example, you could click on the "Qualified Leads" segment of the outcome pie chart to see all the other metrics for just those calls.
*   **Zoom and Pan:** For time-series charts, you can use your mouse to zoom in on a specific date range or pan across the timeline to explore different periods.

## Customizing Your Dashboard

You can customize the layout of your dashboard to focus on the charts and metrics that are most important to you. You can rearrange, resize, and even remove charts to create a personalized view that meets your specific needs.

By leveraging the power of these interactive charts, you can move beyond simple data points and start to uncover the deeper insights that will drive your campaign's success.
