## The Call Details Page

The Call Details page provides a comprehensive, in-depth look at a single conversation between an AI agent and a customer. This page is your go-to resource for understanding the nuances of your customer interactions and for quality assurance purposes.

### Key Components of the Call Details Page

*   **Audio Player:**  At the top of the page, you'll find an audio player that allows you to listen to the full recording of the call. You can play, pause, and skip through the recording as needed.
*   **Interactive Transcript:**  Below the audio player, you'll see a full text transcript of the conversation. The transcript is synchronized with the audio, so as you play the recording, the corresponding text will be highlighted. You can also click on any part of the transcript to jump to that point in the audio.
*   **Speaker Identification:**  Each line of the transcript is clearly marked with the name of the speaker (either the AI agent or the customer), making it easy to follow the conversation.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:**  The transcript is color-coded to indicate the customer's sentiment at different points in the conversation. This allows you to quickly identify moments of frustration, satisfaction, or confusion.
*   **Call Summary:**  On the right-hand side of the page, you'll find a summary of the key details of the call, including the date, time, duration, and outcome.

## Advanced Call Details

In addition to these basic components, the Call Details page also provides access to more advanced information and tools:

*   **Topic Analysis:**  The AI automatically identifies the key topics that were discussed during the call, allowing you to quickly understand the main points of the conversation.
*   **Action Items:**  The AI can also identify any action items or follow-up tasks that were mentioned during the call, such as a request for a callback or a promise to send more information.
*   **Sharing and Collaboration:**  You can easily share a link to the Call Details page with other members of your team, allowing for seamless collaboration and feedback.

By taking advantage of the rich information available on the Call Details page, you can gain a deep understanding of your customer interactions and use that knowledge to improve your campaigns and business processes.
