## The Call Log

The Call Log is your central hub for viewing the details of every call made by your AI agents. From here, you can access recordings, transcripts, and a wealth of other information about each conversation.

### Accessing the Call Log

*   **Customer Information:** The name and phone number of the person who was called.
*   **AI Agent:** The name of the AI agent that handled the call.
*   **Duration:** The length of the call.
*   **Outcome:** The outcome of the call, as determined by the AI.

## Reviewing Call Details
