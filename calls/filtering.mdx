## Finding the Calls That Matter

The CommVoice platform provides a powerful set of filtering tools that allow you to quickly and easily find the specific calls you're interested in. Whether you're looking for all the calls from a particular campaign, all the calls with a certain outcome, or all the calls handled by a specific AI agent, the filtering tools make it easy to narrow down your search.

### How to Use the Filters

You can access the filtering tools from the top of the Call Log page. You can filter your calls by any of the following criteria:

*   **Date Range:**  Find all the calls that were made within a specific date range.
*   **AI Agent:**  See all the calls that were handled by a particular AI agent.
*   **Call Outcome:**  Filter your calls by their outcome, such as "Qualified Lead" or "Appointment Scheduled."
*   **Call Duration:**  Find all the calls that are longer or shorter than a certain duration.
*   **Customer Information:**  Search for calls made to a specific phone number or customer name.

### Combining Filters for Powerful Searches

You can combine multiple filters to create highly specific searches. For example, you could search for all the calls that were:

*   Made in the last 7 days,
*   Handled by your "Sales Agent,"
*   Resulted in a "Qualified Lead" outcome,
*   And were longer than 5 minutes.

This kind of specific search can be incredibly powerful for identifying your most successful calls and understanding the factors that contribute to that success.

## Saving Your Filters

If you frequently use the same set of filters, you can save them for easy access in the future. This allows you to create custom views of your call data that are tailored to your specific needs.

By mastering the use of the filtering tools, you can save time, uncover valuable insights, and focus your attention on the calls that matter most to your business.
