## The Importance of Outcome Management

Call outcomes are at the heart of the CommVoice platform. They are the primary way that you measure the success of your campaigns and track the results of your AI-powered conversations. That's why it's so important to have a clear and well-defined set of outcomes that align with your business goals.

## Standard vs. Custom Outcomes

CommVoice provides a set of standard, pre-configured outcomes that cover the most common scenarios in sales and customer outreach. However, you also have the flexibility to create your own custom outcomes that are specific to your business.

### When to Use Custom Outcomes

You should consider creating custom outcomes when:

*   Your sales process has unique stages that are not covered by the standard outcomes.
*   You want to track specific types of customer inquiries or requests.
*   You are running a campaign with a specific goal that is not represented by the standard outcomes.

## Creating and Managing Outcomes

You can create and manage your call outcomes from the Settings page in the CommVoice dashboard.

### Creating a New Outcome

To create a new outcome, simply click the "Add Outcome" button and provide the following information:

*   **Name:** A short, descriptive name for the outcome.
*   **Description:** A more detailed description of what the outcome represents.
*   **Classification Rules:** The criteria that the AI should use to assign this outcome to a call.

### Editing and Deleting Outcomes

You can edit or delete any of your custom outcomes at any time. However, be aware that changing or deleting an outcome will not affect the classification of past calls.

## Best Practices for Outcome Management

*   **Keep it simple:**  Don't create more outcomes than you need. A smaller, well-defined set of outcomes will be easier to manage and analyze.
*   **Be specific:**  Make sure that each outcome has a clear and unambiguous definition.
*   **Align with your goals:**  Your outcomes should directly reflect the goals of your calling campaigns.
*   **Regularly review your outcomes:**  As your business and campaigns evolve, you may need to update your outcomes to reflect those changes.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your call outcomes are a powerful tool for measuring and improving your campaign performance.
