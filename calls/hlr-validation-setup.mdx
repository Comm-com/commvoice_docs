## Overview

HLR (Home Location Register) validation helps you verify phone number reachability before making calls, significantly improving your campaign performance and reducing wasted resources on inactive numbers.

<Info>
HLR validation is available for all voice campaigns and can be configured at the campaign level with customizable retry logic.
</Info>

## Enabling HLR Validation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Voice Campaign Settings">
    Navigate to your voice campaign and click on the **Voice Agent** configuration step in the campaign wizard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate HLR Validation Section">
    Scroll down to find the **HLR Validation** section below the Numbers and Agents configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure HLR Settings">
    Click the **Configure** button to open the HLR validation settings modal.
    
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/hlr-validation-section.png" alt="HLR Validation section in voice campaign settings" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Auto HLR Validation">
    Toggle the **Auto HLR Validation** switch to enable pre-call number verification.
    
    <Check>
    Once enabled, all numbers will be validated before dialing attempts.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring Retry Logic

When HLR validation is enabled, you can set up intelligent retry logic to handle temporarily unreachable numbers:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Basic Configuration">
### Number of Retries
Set how many times the system should retry failed calls (1-10 retries recommended).

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Lead Generation**: 3-5 retries
- **Customer Service**: 2-3 retries  
- **Sales Calls**: 4-6 retries

### Delay Between Retries
Configure the initial wait time before the first retry (1-60 minutes).

**Best Practices:**
- **Peak Hours**: 5-10 minute delays
- **Off-Peak Hours**: 2-5 minute delays
- **Weekend Campaigns**: 10-15 minute delays
</Tab>

<Tab title="Advanced Timing">
### Additional Time Increment
Set how much extra time is added to each subsequent retry (0-30 minutes).

**Example Configuration:**
- Retries: 5
- Initial Delay: 2 minutes  
- Increment: 3 minutes

**Resulting Schedule:**
- Retry 1: 2 minutes after initial failure
- Retry 2: 5 minutes after initial failure (2+3)
- Retry 3: 8 minutes after initial failure (2+6)
- Retry 4: 11 minutes after initial failure (2+9)
- Retry 5: 14 minutes after initial failure (2+12)

<Tip>
Progressive delays help avoid network congestion and improve success rates for temporarily unavailable numbers.

## Understanding HLR Status Indicators

The HLR validation section displays the current status with color-coded badges:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Enabled" icon="check-circle" color="green">
  HLR validation is active for this campaign. Numbers will be verified before calling.
</Card>

<Card title="Disabled" icon="x-circle" color="gray">
  HLR validation is not active. All numbers will be called without pre-verification.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Viewing HLR History

Track your HLR validation performance by accessing the history:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open HLR Settings">
    Click **Configure** in the HLR Validation section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access History">
    Click **View HLR History** button at the bottom of the settings modal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze Results">
    Review the history table showing:
    - Request ID and timestamp
    - Phone number and validation status
    - Carrier response details
    - Success/failure indicators
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Raw Responses">
    Click **View Raw** for any entry to see the complete HLR response data including carrier information, porting status, and technical details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

- Remove consistently failing numbers from campaigns
- Use analytics to identify optimal validation strategies
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Monitoring">
**Regular Review Schedule:**

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Issues and Solutions

<Warning>
**High Validation Costs**: If HLR costs are unexpectedly high, check your retry settings and consider reducing the number of attempts or increasing delays between retries.
</Warning>

### Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue: Low HLR Success Rates**
- **Cause**: Outdated contact data or poor data sources
- **Solution**: Audit data quality and update contact acquisition processes

**Issue: Poor Retry Performance**
- **Cause**: Retry delays too short or network congestion
- **Solution**: Increase retry intervals and spread attempts across time periods

**Issue: Inconsistent Carrier Results**
- **Cause**: Carrier-specific technical issues or network problems
- **Solution**: Contact support with carrier details and HLR response logs

<Check>
Most HLR validation issues can be resolved by adjusting retry timing or improving contact data quality.

## Integration with Campaign Workflow

HLR validation integrates seamlessly with your existing voice campaign process:

1. **Campaign Launch**: HLR validation begins automatically when campaign starts
2. **Real-Time Processing**: Numbers are validated immediately before each dial attempt  
3. **Automatic Retry Handling**: Failed validations are queued for retry according to your settings
4. **Analytics Integration**: All validation data appears in campaign performance reports
5. **Cost Tracking**: HLR costs are included in overall campaign cost analysis

<Tip>
Enable HLR validation early in your campaign setup to ensure optimal performance from the first call.
