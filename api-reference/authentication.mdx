## Getting Started with the CommVoice API

The CommVoice API allows you to programmatically manage your AI agents, campaigns, and contacts, as well as access your call data and analytics. To get started, you will need to authenticate your requests using an API key.

## Generating an API Key

You can generate an API key from the Settings page in your CommVoice dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Settings">
    Go to Settings â†’ API Keys in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Key">
    Click "Generate New API Key" and give it a descriptive name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Permissions">
    Choose the specific permissions that the key will have (e.g., read-only access to call data).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy and Store Your Key">
    Copy the generated key and store it in a secure location. For security reasons, the key will only be displayed once.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Treat your API keys like passwords. Never expose them in client-side code or commit them to version control.
</Warning>

## Making Authenticated Requests

To make an authenticated request, you will need to include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your request, using the `Bearer` authentication scheme.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     "https://api.commvoice.ai/v1/calls"
```

## Rate Limiting

The CommVoice API uses rate limiting to ensure a high level of performance for all users. The specific rate limits depend on your plan. You can find information about your current rate limit status in the headers of each API response.

By following these simple steps, you can securely authenticate with the CommVoice API and start building powerful integrations.
