## Managing Missed Opportunities

Even with the most effective calling strategy, some of your calls will inevitably go to voicemail. How you handle these missed opportunities can have a big impact on your overall campaign success. The CommVoice platform provides a flexible set of tools for managing voicemails and ensuring that no lead falls through the cracks.

## Voicemail Detection

The first step in managing voicemails is accurately detecting them. CommVoice's AI-powered voicemail detection system can distinguish between a human and a machine with a high degree of accuracy. This ensures that your AI agents don't waste time talking to a voicemail machine and that your call data remains clean and accurate.

## Voicemail Handling Options

Once a voicemail has been detected, you have several options for how to handle the call:

*   **Hang up:**  This is the simplest option. The AI agent will simply hang up the call as soon as it detects a voicemail.
*   **Leave a pre-recorded message:**  You can upload a pre-recorded audio file that your AI agent will leave as a voicemail. This is a great way to ensure a consistent and professional message.
*   **Dynamically generate a message:** For more advanced use cases, you can configure your AI agent to dynamically generate a personalized voicemail message based on the information it has about the customer.

## Voicemail Notifications and Workflows

You can also set up notifications and automated workflows to be triggered when a call goes to voicemail. For example, you could:

*   **Send an email notification** to the sales rep who is assigned to the lead.
*   **Create a task** in your CRM to follow up with the customer.
*   **Add the customer** to a specific email nurture campaign.

By thoughtfully configuring your voicemail integration, you can turn missed calls into new opportunities and ensure that you are making the most of every lead.
