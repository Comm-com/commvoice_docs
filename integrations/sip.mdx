## What is SIP Integration?

SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) integration allows you to connect your existing VoIP phone system to the CommVoice platform. This is a great option for businesses that want to:

*   Use their existing phone numbers with CommVoice.
*   Continue using their existing desk phones or softphones.
*   Maintain a high degree of control over their telephony infrastructure.

## How it Works

When you set up a SIP integration, you are essentially creating a bridge between your phone system and the CommVoice platform. When one of your AI agents makes an outbound call, it will be routed through your SIP trunk and will appear to be coming from one of your existing phone numbers.

## Setting Up a SIP Integration

To set up a SIP integration, you will need to have some technical knowledge of your VoIP phone system. The basic steps are as follows:

1.  **Create a new SIP trunk** in your phone system.
2.  **Configure the trunk** with the credentials provided by CommVoice.
3.  **Create an outbound route** that directs calls from your AI agents to the new SIP trunk.

You can find detailed instructions for setting up a SIP integration with a variety of popular phone systems in our help center.

## Network Configuration

### IP Whitelisting

To ensure proper connectivity between your SIP infrastructure and CommVoice, you'll need to whitelist the following IP addresses in your firewall:

- `44.229.228.186/32`
- `44.238.177.138/32`
- `172.31.9.106/32`

<Warning>
Make sure these IPs are whitelisted before testing your SIP integration to avoid connection issues.
</Warning>

## Benefits of SIP Integration

*   **Flexibility:**  Use your existing phone numbers and infrastructure.
*   **Control:**  Maintain full control over your telephony environment.
*   **Cost-effective:**  Leverage your existing investment in your VoIP phone system.

If you have an existing VoIP phone system, SIP integration is a powerful way to seamlessly connect it to the CommVoice platform.
