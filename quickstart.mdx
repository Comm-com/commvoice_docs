## 1. Configure Your AI Agent

First, create an AI agent with a unique personality and voice. You'll also provide it with the knowledge it needs to have intelligent conversations with your customers.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="robot" title="Create your AI agent persona">
    1.  Navigate to "AI Agents" in your CommVoice dashboard.
    2.  Define your agent's personality, voice, and conversation style.
    3.  Give your agent a name and a role (e.g., "Sales Development Rep").
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="script-text" title="Configure conversation scripts">
    1.  Set your opening script and key talking points.
    2.  Configure responses to common objections.
    3.  Define the qualification questions the agent should ask.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 2. Set Up Your Campaign

Next, create a campaign and upload the list of contacts you want your AI agent to call.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Upload your prospect list">
    Upload a CSV file or sync with your CRM to import your contacts. Be sure to include phone numbers and any other relevant information that can help the AI personalize the conversation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="target" title="Define campaign objectives">
    Choose the goal of your campaign (e.g., lead qualification, appointment setting) and set the criteria for a successful outcome.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 3. Launch and Monitor

With your agent and campaign configured, you're ready to launch. Start with a small test batch to ensure everything is working as expected, then scale up to your full contact list.

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Start your AI calling campaign">
  1.  Review your campaign settings.
  2.  Start with a small test batch of 10-20 calls.
  3.  Monitor the initial results in the dashboard.
  4.  Scale up to your full contact list.
</Accordion>

## 4. Analyze and Optimize

Once your campaign is running, use the CommVoice dashboard to track its performance and identify opportunities for optimization. Review call recordings, analyze conversation transcripts, and A/B test different scripts to continuously improve your results.
