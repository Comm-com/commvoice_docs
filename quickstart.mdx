  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 3. Add Contacts

Before launching your campaign, you need to add contacts to your CommVoice platform. You have two options for importing your contact data:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="upload" title="Upload CSV file via dashboard">
    The easiest way to add contacts is through the web interface:
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to the uploads page">
        Go to [https://app.commvoice.ai/audience/uploads](https://app.commvoice.ai/audience/uploads) in your browser.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Prepare your CSV file">
        Ensure your CSV file includes the following columns:
        - Phone numbers (required)
        - Contact names
        - Email addresses
        - Any custom fields you want to track
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Upload and map fields">
        Upload your CSV file and map the columns to the appropriate contact fields in the platform.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    
    <Tip>
    This method is perfect for one-time imports or when you have a static list of contacts to add.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Use the API endpoint">
    For automated integrations or real-time contact updates, use our webhook API endpoint.

    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 4. Launch and Monitor

With your agent and campaign configured, you're ready to launch. Start with a small test batch to ensure everything is working as expected, then scale up to your full contact list.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Launch your campaign">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Review campaign settings">
        Double-check your agent selection, call schedule, and volume limits before launching.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Start with a test batch">
        Launch with 10-20 contacts first to test your setup and scripts.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Monitor initial results">
        Watch the first few calls in real-time and review call recordings.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Scale up gradually">
        Once you're satisfied with performance, increase to your full contact list.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    
    <Warning>
    **Critical:** Never launch with your full contact list without testing first. Always start small!
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Monitor performance">

## 5. Analyze and Optimize

Once your campaign is running, use the CommVoice dashboard to track its performance and identify opportunities for optimization.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="chart-bar" title="Track key performance indicators">
    Monitor these essential metrics to measure success:
    
    - **Answer Rate:** Percentage of calls that are answered (aim for 15-25%)
    - **Conversation Duration:** Average length of successful conversations
    - **Success Rate:** Percentage of calls that achieve your defined objectives
    - **Lead Quality:** Quality of leads generated based on your criteria
    
    <Tip>
    **Benchmark expectations:** Most campaigns see 15-25% answer rates and 5-15% success rates initially.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="cogs" title="Optimize based on data">
    <Steps>
