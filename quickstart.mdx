## 1. Configure Your AI Agent

First, create an AI agent with a unique personality and voice. You'll also provide it with the knowledge it needs to have intelligent conversations with your customers.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="robot" title="Create your AI agent persona">
    1.  Navigate to "AI Agents" in your CommVoice dashboard.
    2.  Define your agent's personality, voice, and conversation style.
    3.  Give your agent a name and a role (e.g., "Sales Development Rep").
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="book" title="Configure conversation scripts">
    1.  Set your opening script and key talking points.
    2.  Configure responses to common objections.
    3.  Define the qualification questions the agent should ask.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 2. Set Up Your Campaign

Next, create a campaign and upload the list of contacts you want your AI agent to call.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Upload your prospect list">
    Upload a CSV file or sync with your CRM to import your contacts. Be sure to include phone numbers and any other relevant information that can help the AI personalize the conversation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="bullseye" title="Define campaign objectives">
    Choose the goal of your campaign (e.g., lead qualification, appointment setting) and set the criteria for a successful outcome.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 3. Launch and Monitor

With your agent and campaign configured, you're ready to launch. Start with a small test batch to ensure everything is working as expected, then scale up to your full contact list.

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Start your AI calling campaign">
  1.  Review your campaign settings.
  2.  Start with a small test batch of 10-20 calls.
  3.  Monitor the initial results in the dashboard.
  4.  Scale up to your full contact list.
</Accordion>

## 4. Analyze and Optimize

Once your campaign is running, use the CommVoice dashboard to track its performance and identify opportunities for optimization. Review call recordings, analyze conversation transcripts, and A/B test different scripts to continuously improve your results.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="phone" title="How do we connect VoIP?">
    We offer two options:

    **Use our VoIP service:**  
    We can provide a fully managed VoIP service, ready to use, without requiring setup on your side.

    **Connect to your SIP trunk:**  
    If you have your own VoIP infrastructure, we can integrate directly with your SIP trunk. Just share your SIP connection details, as SIP is the default protocol we use for handling outbound calls.

    <Warning>
    **Important:** You'll need to whitelist the following IP addresses in your firewall:
    - `44.229.228.186/32`
    - `44.238.177.138/32`
    - `172.31.9.106/32`
    </Warning>

    In both cases, our team can coordinate with your IT to ensure smooth setup and testing.

  <Accordion icon="wrench" title="How do we improve the AI bot? How can we monitor its performance?">
    We analyze early-stage data to find key improvement areas:

    - **Early hang-ups** (often linked to the opening message)
    - Our system can run split-tests, but your team's business insights are crucial for optimization
